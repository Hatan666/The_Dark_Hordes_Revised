# The Dark Hordes Revised - Brief Summary of the Project
This file was written to guide the development of **The Dark Hordes Revised** (*TDHR*) campaign. The following text will contain an overview of the campaign and synopsis of each of the scenarios. Please note that this is not the complete screenplay and is for reference purposes only.

## Stories & Lore
As an assumption, this campaign must follow mainline canons. However, if adjustments are made based on what is acceptable to the mainline, creative thinking may be limited. Therefore, we intend to take the in-between.

Specifically, the following stories are being considered. They are only in draft form and these may not be fully compatible with the mainline lore-wise. Therefore, there can be great deal of fine-tuning of the work-in-progress phase.

### Before Stories
**Gwiti Ha'atel** and **Nati Ha'atel** were born around 1075 YW. Their parents died in the civil war waged by **Mizenwyn** in 1081 YW, and the orphaned twin brothers were taken in and raised by the white mage. They were taught magical knowledge and had promising qualities, but could not go to Alduin. Because Alduin had already fallen into the hands of Mizenwyn.

Later, the white mage who had raised them was arrested for loyalty to the defunct High Council of Archmagi, and the brothers were once again left without relatives. They do, however, accidentally discover the source of basic necromantic knowledge in his library and make their living while secretly studying it on their own.

After Mizenwyn is overthrown by **Niryone** and **Elynia**, the brothers come of age. They join the army in despair, partly because they are still inexperienced, have no skills, and have found no better place to live. Their subsequent years went relatively well until the Battle of Erzen.

### Introduction
After the civil war near Glamdrol in 1094 YW, the Great Chief emerged from among the orcs and attacked the Wesnothian outpost known for the Stone of Erzen the following year. Gwiti and Nati, seeing that their side was losing the battle, employed the necromancy they had been secretly studying to resurrect the corpses of their former enemies and have them fight as soldiers.

However, the cavalry that arrived as reinforcements clashed not with the orcs but with their undead, and the battlefield was in chaos, resulting in their disastrous defeat. The brothers escaped but were soon captured by the Wesnothians. Fearing that their corpses would rise from their graves, the people decided to send them to the sea to be drowned to ensure their demise. The brothers were put on rudderless ship and banished from the Continent.

However, the ship carrying Gwiti and Nati was struck by an unexpected storm and collapsed, separating the brothers and sending them ashore to separate lands.

### Main Stories
*See [Scenarios](#Scenarios) for now.*

### Stories After Campaign
Gwiti is forced to escape east from Wesnoth due to the betrayal by **Tanar** and the interference of the Northern Alliance. He reaches Estmark and escapes for several months, while hiding from the military patrols.

Eventually, Gwiti is confronted again by Elynia, whom he had previously defeated. This time **Aretu** is at her side, and Elynia overthrows Gwiti with the Power of Light. With this, she is crowned the Lady of Light for the first time.

But just before his destruction, Gwiti pronounces the ultimate curse upon her: Elynia shall remain alive until all beings have fallen to their doom.
